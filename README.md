 👋 Hi, I’m Foo Xin Chee, living in Johor Malaysia. I enroll in professional online courses from Cousera. Let Learn Digital and build something that makes a difference to the community.
 
 I am going to share with you how to become a veteran developer like me. I started programming using language like C, Visual Basic, ASP, PHP, OOP with SQL, MySQL database.Well, it does not just end there .

Technology change so fast. New programming languages, frameworks (Laravel, NodeJS, React, Vue, NextJS NuxtJS, TypesScript) and libraries pop up all the time. I am repeating myself to keep learning, increase skills, and grow superb by solving problems through technology .

So a programmer building software twenty years ago was solving the same problems (more or less) as an engineer today. 
It doesn’t matter if you are an experienced or newbie programmer. Learning by doing brings much more results than learning passively, especially when it comes to programming. .
